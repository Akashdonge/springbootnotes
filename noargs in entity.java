Exactly, Akash! You're thinking in the right direction. Let me explain it step by step with your idea polished for an interview-level explanation. ðŸ”§âœ¨

âœ… Your Understanding:
"Using the no-args constructor, JPA creates object references, and then applies reflection (like in PATCH mapping) to set field values."

ðŸ”„ Refined Explanation:
Yes! Here's how it works behind the scenes:

ðŸ’¡ Step-by-Step:
JPA loads a row from the database, for example:

bash
Copy
Edit
id=1, type='Deluxe', base_price=299.99
It needs to turn that data into a Java object (Room room = ...), but it doesn't use new Room(type, price) â€” because JPA doesn't know the values at compile time.

Instead, it does this internally:

java
Copy
Edit
Room room = Room.class.getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance(); // calls no-arg constructor
Now JPA has an empty Room object in memory.

It uses reflection or field access to inject values into the object:

java
Copy
Edit
room.setId(1);
room.setType("Deluxe");
room.setBasePrice(new BigDecimal("299.99"));
or directly sets fields like:

java
Copy
Edit
Field field = Room.class.getDeclaredField("type");
field.setAccessible(true);
field.set(room, "Deluxe");
âœ… So Yes, You're Right:
@NoArgsConstructor lets JPA first create a blank object reference, and then it uses reflection to populate it, just like PATCH/PUT updates fields later.

ðŸ’¬ If Youâ€™re Explaining in Interview:
"JPA needs a no-args constructor to create a basic object using reflection. Once the object is created, JPA sets its fields using reflection or setters. It's similar to how PATCH or deserialization works, where values are injected after creating the empty object."

Let me know if you want a real example with PATCH mapping + JPA + @NoArgsConstructor too!
